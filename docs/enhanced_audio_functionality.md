- **Timestamp Integration**: Precise filler word locations with context

## System Prompt Templates

### Vocal Coaching System Instruction
```
You are an expert vocal coach and speech analysis specialist. Listen to this audio recording carefully. 
Provide detailed, constructive feedback on the speaker's vocal delivery. Focus specifically on:

- Pace and Rhythm: Is it too fast, too slow, or varied appropriately?
- Tone and Intonation: Does the tone match the message? Is there enough vocal variety?
- Clarity and Articulation: Are words spoken clearly? Are there issues with mumbling?
- Filler Words: Identify usage of 'um', 'uh', 'like', etc.
- Volume and Projection: Is the speaker audible and confident?
- Pauses: Are pauses used effectively, or are they awkward?

Provide your feedback as a JSON array of strings, where each string is a distinct feedback point. Aim for up to 5 feedback points. 
Be encouraging and actionable. 
Return ONLY the JSON array. Do not include any other text, preamble, or sign-off.
```

### Contextual Analysis System Prompt
```
You're a professional speech coach. Analyze this transcript in the context of: "{user_prompt}". Provide:
1. 3 specific strengths
2. 3 very specific content improvements
3. 3 vocal delivery suggestions
4. Key speaking style observations

Return JSON ONLY
Keep the responses casual and friendly and light!
Do not include markdown or text formatting
```

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration Example
```typescript
// Vocal coaching feedback
const getVocalCoachingFeedback = async (audioUuid: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/ai/audio/vocal-coaching', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ audio_uuid: audioUuid })
  });
  return response.json();
};

// Contextual analysis
const getContextualAnalysis = async (audioUuid: string, prompt: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/ai/audio/contextual-analysis', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ 
      audio_uuid: audioUuid,
      user_prompt: prompt 
    })
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

## Configuration Options

### Validation Levels
- **Minimal**: Basic checks only (duration, file format)
- **Standard**: Standard quality checks (default)
- **Strict**: Comprehensive validation with higher thresholds

### Quality Thresholds (Configurable)
- Minimum duration: 3.0 seconds
- Maximum duration: 300.0 seconds (5 minutes)
- Minimum words: 5
- Maximum filler ratio: 30%
- Optimal speaking rate: 120-160 WPM

## Error Handling

The enhanced system provides comprehensive error handling:

1. **Validation Errors**: Clear feedback on what needs to be fixed
2. **Processing Errors**: Graceful fallbacks when AI processing fails
3. **Quality Warnings**: Non-blocking suggestions for improvement
4. **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking for debugging

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always validate audio before processing with strict requirements
2. Use contextual analysis for specific use cases (interviews, presentations, etc.)
3. Implement progressive enhancement (start with basic validation, add features)
4. Provide clear user feedback based on validation results

### For Users
1. Record in quiet environments
2. Speak clearly and at moderate pace (120-160 WPM)
3. Aim for 30-60 second responses for optimal analysis
4. Minimize filler words and long pauses
5. Provide context when requesting analysis

## Migration Guide

### Existing Code Updates
The enhanced system is backward compatible. Existing `/ai/interview/evaluate` endpoints will automatically use improved prompts and validation.

### Recommended Upgrades
1. Replace basic audio validation with enhanced validation
2. Use contextual analysis endpoints for specific use cases
3. Implement quality scoring for user feedback
4. Add recommendation systems for user improvement

This enhanced audio question functionality provides a professional-grade speech analysis system with comprehensive guardrails, detailed feedback, and actionable recommendations for improvement.
